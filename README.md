# IORDS Full Example Lecture

Your aim is create a python package which can predict a country happiness score according to a set of features (details later on). For this project you will:
* explore the data from the World Happiness Report 2021
* progressively move functions from your Jupyter notebook to a python module in VS code
* use software version control with git as you implement your changes
* include tests in your code so that to do continuous integration
* create a python package called `happypred` for other users to easily use your code
* train a machine learning (ML) model on these data
* show how to use your python package with a Jupyter notebook example 

You can access the lecture Jupyter notebook by clicking on the "Launch Binder" badge.
